the experience of language is entirely dependent on the collective psychology of the people who speak it at the time. its meaning is sewn into the fabric of both time and culture and is never the same from one point to another. this fluidity is amplified when you bring translation from one language to another into the equation. some languages carry more expressive power than others and when translated, even with the highest precision and accuracy, can lose some meaning or nuance.

when i read the bible with this in mind, i like to look more deeply into the meaning of verses by looking into the etymology of a word or the meaning of it in its original language. this can illuminate new perspectives of one word, verse, paragraph or entire story. translation can only be as accurate as its destination language allows and most often it is not one to one. having some curiosity about other languages and vocabulary can expand your perspective, offering more shades with which to paint life into your words.

everyone should learn what their words mean and how they can use them to more accurately depict life!
